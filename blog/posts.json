    "content": "Creating this website was a fun project. I wanted something that reflected my style - modern, animated, and with a cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nThe key features include:\n- Animated particle background using HTML5 Canvas\n- Responsive design that works on all devices\n- Smooth fade-in animations\n- Clean, minimalist layout\n\nI used vanilla JavaScript for the animations to keep things lightweight and fast. The cyan and black color scheme gives it that futuristic feel I was going for."
