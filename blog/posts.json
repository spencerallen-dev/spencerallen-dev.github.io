    "content": "I've been diving into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) lately and it's been a fascinating journey!\n\nMCP allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources in a standardized way. I've been experimenting with creating custom MCP servers that can:\n- Access local files and repositories\n- Integrate with web APIs\n- Provide specialized functionality for specific tasks\n\nThe protocol is surprisingly flexible and well-designed. You can build servers in any language that supports JSON-RPC, and the client-server architecture makes it easy to add new capabilities.\n\nI'm working on a few custom tools right now and learning a lot about how AI assistants can be extended beyond their base capabilities. More updates coming soon as I continue tinkering!"

    "content": "Creating this website was a fun project. I wanted something that reflected my style - modern, animated, and with a cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nThe key features include:\n- Animated particle background using HTML5 Canvas\n- Responsive design that works on all devices\n- Smooth fade-in animations\n- Clean, minimalist layout\n\nI used vanilla JavaScript for the animations to keep things lightweight and fast. The cyan and black color scheme gives it that futuristic feel I was going for."
